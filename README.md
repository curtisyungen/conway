# Conway's Game of Life
**by Curtis Yungen**

August 2019

Conway's Game of Life is a simulation based on an initial state and four simple rules governing how this state evolves. Read the rules here: Link to Wikipedia. 

In this project, a user can draw a particular pattern on a 25 x 25 grid and click Start to commence the simulation. The pattern then mutates based on the four aforementioned rules, forming new patterns and continuing until the simulation reaches a static or oscillating state.

Check out the project here: https://conway-cjy.herokuapp.com.

### Rules:
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
